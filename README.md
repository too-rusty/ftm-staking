### How does it work
when we stake tokens, they are in unlocked stake .....
i guess locking prevents us from unstaking them .... not sure, it can be a way to earn more APY

#### PendingRewards
the pending rewards , its a view function, let's us know about the pending rewards balance.

#### ClaimRewards
lets us claim the rewards , added to our wallet
guess rewards can be claimed instantaneously ....

#### UnlockedStake
our staking in the validator, let's us know our stake
this is not the Locked stake , need to check how its different from unlocked stake

#### RestakeRewards
adds the reward to unlocked stake
so unlockedStake should go up ....
and sure it does ......


#### Undelegate
requires a unique wrID that is used to claim delegations at a later point of time

#### WithdrawRewards
withdraw with that key, need to try after a week because withdrawal time is 1 week afaik
